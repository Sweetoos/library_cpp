# Library Management System

This is a project to practice OOP, STL and resource management. The idea was generated by ChatGPT

## Concept
Develop a console-based library management system that allows librarians to manage books, patrons, and transactions efficiently. The system should handle tasks such as adding new books, managing patron information, checking out and returning books, and generating reports.

Key Features:

1. Book Management:
        Create a class for books with attributes like title, author, genre, ISBN, availability, etc.
        Implement functions to add new books, remove books, update book details, and search for books by various criteria (title, author, ISBN, etc.).

2. Patron Management:
        Create a class for patrons with attributes like name, contact information, membership status, etc.
        Implement functions to add new patrons, remove patrons, update patron details, and search for patrons.

3. Transaction Management:
        Create a class to handle transactions such as book checkouts and returns.
        Implement functions to facilitate book checkout (including checking availability), book return, and managing due dates.

4. Reporting:
        Implement functions to generate reports such as overdue books, popular books, frequent patrons, etc.
        Utilize STL containers like vectors, maps, or sets to store and manage data efficiently.

5. Resource Management:
        Ensure proper resource management using smart pointers (such as std::unique_ptr or std::shared_ptr) to manage dynamic memory allocation for objects.
        Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principle to handle resources like file handling for storing data persistently.

6. User Interface:
        Design a user-friendly console interface for librarians to interact with the system.
        Utilize OOP principles to structure the user interface code into separate classes for better maintainability.

Additional Challenges:

    Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for librarians.
    Utilize exception handling to gracefully handle errors and edge cases.
    Implement sorting and filtering functionalities for efficient data retrieval.
    Allow for scalability, such as handling a large number of books and patrons efficiently.

By incorporating OOP principles, STL containers, and proper resource management techniques, this project not only provides hands-on experience with these concepts but also simulates a real-world scenario where such systems are widely used.
